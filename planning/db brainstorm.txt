mongodb:

was thinking of adding foreign key in user(i.e, food) but makes me think if we should use relational vs non relational

food:
 - name
 - calories(mandatory)
 - serving size (g, lbs, oz, ml, etc.)
 - fat(saturated and unsaturated breakdown)?
 - carbs
 - protein
 - (micronutrients???) -> dont add for now
 - other macros(nutrients) -> discuss later
 - created by(xyz) -> instead of foreign key

user:
 - height
 - weight
 - bodyfat(optional)
 - calorie goal


weight:
 - user
 - trackers user's weight each time they log it
